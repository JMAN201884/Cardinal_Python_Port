This is a public open source project, free for anyone to use. The projects origon or the idea of it came from an anime. The anime that the idea came from is called Sword Art Online, the program/programs that run the game is called the Cardinal system. So, that paired with the concept of a commandline base program/OS, is what game me the idea for this multi tool and its name.

The basic interface is my by commandline to keep it simple, so the simplest way I could make the this tool was by keeping the commands short and simple to help with ease of use. The commands are also simple words to mitagate complex programming, and simplify the ease for the naxt update. Thousgh this multi tool is not too special but is capable of doing quite a bit of daily tasks that are commonly used day to day.

Thank you for downloading, hope you enjoy your expeariance with Cardinal.
